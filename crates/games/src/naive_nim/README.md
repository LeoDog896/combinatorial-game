Nim is the heart of impartial combinatorial game theory.
Its a game about removing objects from heaps.
Despite its ability to be rigidly analyzed,
it still makes a great example as an implementation of the `Game` trait.

This implements a _naive_ version of Nim - i.e., it doesn't benefit
from any of the impartial analysis techniques implemented in this game solver.

If you are looking for a fast variant of nim, one is implemented in the core `game-solver` crate.
