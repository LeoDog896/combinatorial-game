Order and Chaos is a Tic Tac Toe variant that plays on a 6x6 square board.

The game is played by two players, order and chaos. Order plays first, and places Xs and Os on the board. Chaos also plays Xs and Os, but Chaos's goal is to make Order tie the game.

5 in a row wins the game for Order - otherwise, Chaos wins. This serves as an exemplary example for the simplicity in implementation, showing how trivial it is to implement a new game.
