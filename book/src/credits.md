A lot of information here would not have been possible without these lovely resources:

- [Chessprogramming](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page) for their in-depth information about complex game solving
- Various reference implementations:
    - [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) for lists of heuristics used
    - [AlphaZero](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go) as a reference for a reinforcement learning implementation.
- [Pascal Pons's guide](http://blog.gamesolver.org/solving-connect-four/04-alphabeta/) for a simple overview of topics covered in chessprogramming
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) for external references in regards to game optimization.
