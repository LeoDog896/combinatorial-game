A lot of information here would not have been possible without these lovely resources:

- [Chessprogramming](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page) for their in-depth information about complex game solving
    - [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) and [Pleco](https://github.com/pleco-rs/Pleco/) as reference implementations of complex combinatorial game solvers
- [Pascal Pons's guide](http://blog.gamesolver.org/solving-connect-four/04-alphabeta/) for a simple overview of topics covered in chessprogramming
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) for external references in regards to game optimization.
