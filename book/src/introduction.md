# Introduction

[Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) is a general study of games. Many of these games are solved with human heuristics (for example, where [impartial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impartial_game) [combinatorial games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory) are solved by generalizing the game to Nim).

However, computation is still important in mathematics as it helps mathematicians find underlying patterns to build said heuristics.

That is the purpose of `game-solver`. It helps solve various games, and allows users to play against the AI, analyze the game tree, and more.
